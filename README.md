# voice-based-emotion-recognition-using-Transformers
The proposed system introduces a transformative approach to emotion recognition by harnessing the power of transformer models.the proposed system integrates advanced natural language processing techniques and pre trained models. primary goal is to accurately identify and classify human emotions from speech signals in real time. the system aims to achieve high accuracy and robustness in emotion recognition , handling variations in speech patterns,tone, language.
